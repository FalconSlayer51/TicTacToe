# TicTacToe: The If-Else Wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

Welcome to **TicTacToe AI**, the groundbreaking, cutting-edge implementation of artificial intelligence built entirely with... wait for it... **if-else statements**. Yes, you read that right. This isn't just any AI; it's the AI your computer science professor warned you about.  

## üéÆ What is This?  
It's a TicTacToe game, but with a twist: the "AI" opponent has been crafted with an artistic collection of if-else statements. Forget about boring things like neural networks or Minimax algorithms; this is where true *engineering magic* happens.  

## üõ† Features  
- **Single-Player vs. AI:** Battle against an AI that's smart enough to frustrate you but dumb enough to occasionally let you win.  
- **Two-Player Mode:** Because sometimes you just need to settle scores with a friend.  
- **Classic 3x3 Grid:** Revolutionary design. Truly timeless.  
- **Impressive AI Decisions:** Meticulously handcrafted with love, logic, and lots of `else if` clauses.  

## ü§ñ About the AI  
This AI doesn't "learn" or "adapt." It doesn't care about "strategy" or "winning." It simply follows the holy gospel of nested conditionals:  
1. Can it win on the next move? Sure, why not.  
2. Can it block your winning move? Fine, it‚Äôll do that.  
3. Otherwise, it'll just pick the first empty spot it finds, because why overthink it?  

It's like playing against a very determined robot that read a book titled *"TicTacToe for Dummies"* and decided to stop at Chapter 3.  

## üíª Installation
